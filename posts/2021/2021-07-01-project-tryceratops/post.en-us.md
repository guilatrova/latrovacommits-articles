It's a linter to help python developers write nice and clean `try` / `except` blocks.

## Why a linter?

I got very interested in writing a linter, mostly because I had no idea how I would be able to use Python to lint more Python.

https://twitter.com/guilatrova/status/1406205142224023552

It seemed so hard that I wondered if I would be able to do it. **More important than that, I realized that:**

### üìà People seemed interested into writing better exceptions in Python

After publishing my article on [Handling exceptions in Python like a pro üêç üí£](https://blog.guilatrova.dev/handling-exceptions-in-python-like-a-pro/) I got so surprised by the increased traffic in this blog:

https://twitter.com/guilatrova/status/1395347517131329537

It went from ~1-2 people daily (me and my mom probably) to ~20-50 people daily.

So it made me think that writing good and well defined try/except blocks would be something that developers would like to do.

### üç∞ Linters make your life easier

Without linters, would you be able manage every unused import in your project? Maybe, but it would be a pain and it's very easy to forget about it.

That's another reason that made me realize that having a tool to check my code and give me feedback is a great way to keep the quality without the struggle.

## üêç Processing Python Code

The first question is: **How can Python understand Python?**
I started considering reading a file like a bare string (e.g. `def func(): return 1`), splitting it by whitespaces, and reading it token by token.

No, I didn't do that.

Thank God it was not required. Python has `ast` that made it insanely simple.

### üå≥ Interpreting code with AST

AST stands for `Abstract Syntax Trees` which means you can read Python code, any block you wish, iterate over the syntax and process it.
Combine this with [`astpretty`](https://github.com/asottile/astpretty) and you have a powerful debugging tool.

My process developing this linter was:

1. Creating some sample Python code with a violation I would like to help with;
2. Running `astpretty` on the sample file to understand what I wanted to check;
3. Coding the analyzer logic;

```py
# Output from: astpretty --no except_bare.py
Module(
    body=[
        Expr(
            value=Constant(value="\nViolation:\n\nDon't use bare except\n", kind=None),
        ),
        FunctionDef(
            name='func',
            args=arguments(posonlyargs=[], args=[], vararg=None, kwonlyargs=[], kw_defaults=[], kwarg=None, defaults=[]),
            body=[
                Try(
                    body=[
                        Assign(
                            targets=[Name(id='a', ctx=Store())],
                            value=Constant(value=1, kind=None),
                            type_comment=None,
                        ),
                    ],
                    handlers=[
                        ExceptHandler(
                            type=None,
                            name=None,
                            body=[Raise(exc=None, cause=None)],
                        ),
                    ],
                    orelse=[],
                    finalbody=[],
                ),
            ],
            decorator_list=[],
            returns=None,
            type_comment=None,
        ),
    ],
    type_ignores=[],
)
```

As you can see, the top level object is the `Module` which contains a `body` with `Expr` and `FunctionDef`, which also has a `body` and so on...

The effort to achieve that is nearly 0, your only job is to read the python file as text and invoke `ast.parse`.

### üö™ Visiting Nodes

I relied on `ast.NodeVisitor` class to analyze my code. It allows me to iterate and filter over nodes (e.g. `FunctionDef`).
The behavior is simple, straightforward, and helps to dive into specific statements when they happen.

You just have to inherit from that class, define a method named `visit_[NODE_NAME](self, node)` and we're good to start coding.

Take for example the analyzer to avoid verbose reraises.

The goal is to avoid people from writing:

```py
try:
    ...
except Exception as ex:
    raise ex  # <-- This is verbose
```

So they can write it like:

```py
try:
    ...
except Exception:
    raise  # <-- This is clean
```

For such case, with `astpretty` help, I learned that I want to visit `ExceptHandler` objects that contains any `name`, and iterate from there to find violations. [The final analyzer code is:](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/blob/56dbdf8/src/tryceratops/analyzers/exception_block.py#L24-L41):

```py
class ExceptVerboseReraiseAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer, ast.NodeVisitor):  # <-- Inherit from ast.NodeVisitor
    violation_code = codes.VERBOSE_RERAISE

    @visit_error_handler
    def visit_ExceptHandler(self, node: ast.ExceptHandler) -> None:  # <-- We only want "except" blocks
        def is_raise_with_name(stm: ast.stmt, name: str):
            if isinstance(stm, ast.Raise) and isinstance(stm.exc, ast.Name):
                return stm.exc.id == name
            return False

        # If no name is set, then it's impossible to be verbose
        # since you don't have the object
        if node.name:
            for child in ast.walk(node):  # <-- We iterate over all children in that node
                if is_raise_with_name(child, node.name):  # <-- If condition is true, we found a violation
                    self._mark_violation(child)

        self.generic_visit(node)
```

### üí¨ Capturing Comments in Python with `tokenize`

I never desired to enforce all linter rules on the developer. I like flexibility and, well, **the code is yours**. I want you to disable rules that don't please you by settings comments like: `# notc: VIOLATION CODE`.

After gathering all violations in code using `ast`, I thought it would be very easy to capture such comments.

Turns out that I was wrong...

`ast` does not handle comments, afterall, comments are not really python code.

I had then to use another lib (`tokenize`) to do that. This was boring because I had to read line by line and filter any comments that matches a regex, see the function:

```py
def parse_ignore_comments(content: TextIOWrapper) -> Generator[IgnoreViolation, None, None]:
    for toktype, tokval, start, *_ in tokenize.generate_tokens(content.readline):
        if toktype == tokenize.COMMENT:
            if match := re.search(IGNORE_TOKEN_PATT, tokval):
                yield _build_ignore_line(match, start)
```

Then Tryceratops CLI ended up handling a tuple of: filename, parsed ast, list of comments.

### üö¶ Testing scenarios with Pytest

Another cool challenge was: how to write tests? How can someone keep track of python code to be tested under python code?

For that, there's a directory `tests/samples` for python files that intentionally violates specific rules.

The testing got very simple once I defined 2 helper functions: `read_sample` and `assert_violation`

```py
def read_sample(filename: str) -> ast.AST:
    ref_dir = f"{os.path.dirname(__file__)}/samples/violations/"
    path = f"{ref_dir}{filename}.py"

    with open(path) as sample:
        content = sample.read()
        loaded = ast.parse(content)
        return loaded


def assert_violation(code: str, msg: str, line: int, col: int, violation: Violation):
    assert violation.line == line
    assert violation.col == col
    assert violation.code == code
    assert violation.description == msg
```

Testing violations got very simple, I don't even need to mock anything.

```py
def test_verbose_reraise():
    tree = read_sample("except_verbose_reraise")
    analyzer = analyzers.ExceptVerboseReraiseAnalyzer()
    code, msg = codes.VERBOSE_RERAISE

    assert_verbose = partial(assert_violation, code, msg)  # <-- I'm lazy, make function shorter

    violations = analyzer.check(tree, "filename")  # <-- Run analyzer
    assert len(violations) == 2
    first, second = violations

    assert_verbose(20, 8, first)  # <-- assert line, offset, expected violation
    assert_verbose(28, 12, second)  # <-- assert line, offset, expected violation
```

After getting the first analyzer passing, I started following a TDD approach where I first created a file with the intended violation, then wrote the test, and finally implemented the passing code.

It's hard to test such stuff manually, so writing unit tests made me a lot more productive.

## üßæ CLI and Configs

Once the analyzers were set (and somewhat working) I had to make it usable, and linters fit well as a command line interface, so you can run it like: `tryceratops file.py` or maybe `tryceratops pydir`.

### Using `click` as Python CLI

[Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) is a simple framework to wrap your python code around a command line interface quickly. It's as simple as wrapping your function with a few decorators, see:

```py
EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG_OPTION = dict(is_flag=True, help="Whether to enable experimental analyzers.")
IGNORE_OPTION = dict(
    multiple=True,
    help="A violation to be ignored. e.g. -i TC200 -i TC201",
    type=click.Choice(CODE_CHOICES),
)
EXCLUDE_OPTION = dict(multiple=True, help="A dir to be excluded. e.g. -x tests/ -x fixtures/")

@click.command()
@click.argument("dir", nargs=-1)
@click.option("--experimental", **EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG_OPTION)
@click.option("-i", "--ignore", **IGNORE_OPTION)
@click.option("-x", "--exclude", **EXCLUDE_OPTION)
@click.version_option(tryceratops.__version__)
def entrypoint(dir: Tuple[str], experimental: bool, ignore: Tuple[str, ...], exclude: Tuple[str, ...]):
    ...

def main():
    logging.config.dictConfig(LOGGING_CONFIG)
    entrypoint()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Once I set some decorators like `@click.option` I had to receive and manage specific arguments which reflects the options I defined.
It's indeed simple. The annoying part was to figure out how to use some options (the documentation is not clear).

It took me a while to find out:

- `is_flag` should be used instead of a boolean option.
- if you want to allow multiple arguments you have to set different attributes. `nargs=-1` for the main argument and `multiple=True` for options. Not intuitive.

### Supporting `pre-commit`

I love [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/), it ensures that I'm not commiting some sort of code that will be a problem on CI, that I'm using all assigned vars, that all imports are in use, and that some other small improvements like end-of-line and trailing whitespace are clean. I wanted to promote the same feature for devs to benefit from this as well.

It's indeed very simple, I just had to create a file named: [`pre-commit-hooks.yaml`](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/blob/main/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) with the following:

```yaml
-   id: tryceratops
    name: tryceratops
    description: "Manage your exceptions in Python like a PRO"
    entry: tryceratops
    language: python
    language_version: python3
    types: [python]
    require_serial: true
```

Easy! Now anyone can add a new pre-commit hook in their repo like:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops
    rev: v0.2.3
    hooks:
      - id: tryceratops
```

### Supporting `pyproject.toml`

The next step would be to support [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) by allowing configs to be defined at the project level.
Maybe you don't like some violation that I defined, that's fine, it shouldn't refrain you from benefiting from using Tryceratops.

The goal is to support configs that someone would usually pass through CLI like:

```toml
[tool.tryceratops]
exclude = ["samples"]
ignore = ["TC002", "TC200", "TC300"]
experimental = true
```

Reading it was quite easy, there's a lib named `toml` that, guess what, reads and generates toml files.

```py
import toml

...

def load_config(dir: Sequence[str]) -> Optional[PyprojectConfig]:
    toml_file = find_pyproject_toml(dir)

    if toml_file:
        config = toml.load(toml_file)
        return config.get("tool", {}).get("tryceratops", {})
```

The challenge would be to find out whether a `pyproject.toml` file exists or not.

To be honest I wasn't sure on the best way to do it. Someone can run `tryceratops` from **anywhere** in the directory tree and it should always work! So **I can't infer that the CLI is always being invoked from the project root**.

Instead of struggling to find a solution myself (that probably would be not that good), I realized that I could learn what other projects are doing. For instance, I checked on [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and adjusted it (by simplifying) to fit my needs, that's what I ended up with:

```py
def find_project_root(srcs: Sequence[str]) -> Path:
    """Return a directory containing .git, .hg, or pyproject.toml.

    That directory will be a common parent of all files and directories
    passed in `srcs`.

    If no directory in the tree contains a marker that would specify it's the
    project root, the root of the file system is returned.
    """
    if not srcs:
        srcs = [str(Path.cwd().resolve())]

    path_srcs = [Path(Path.cwd(), src).resolve() for src in srcs]

    # A list of lists of parents for each 'src'. 'src' is included as a
    # "parent" of itself if it is a directory
    src_parents = [list(path.parents) + ([path] if path.is_dir() else []) for path in path_srcs]

    common_base = max(
        set.intersection(*(set(parents) for parents in src_parents)),
        key=lambda path: path.parts,
    )

    for directory in (common_base, *common_base.parents):
        if (directory / ".git").exists():
            return directory

        if (directory / ".hg").is_dir():
            return directory

        if (directory / "pyproject.toml").is_file():
            return directory

    return directory


def find_pyproject_toml(path_search_start: Tuple[str, ...]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Find the absolute filepath to a pyproject.toml if it exists"""
    path_project_root = find_project_root(path_search_start)
    path_pyproject_toml = path_project_root / "pyproject.toml"
    if path_pyproject_toml.is_file():
        return str(path_pyproject_toml)
```

It's a very great idea to check on `.git` or `pyproject.toml` itself to decide whether it's the project root and, obviously, it worked just fine.

## üì¶ Publishing Package to Pypi with Flit

Publishing to pypi is the fun part! Making it available and easy distributable for everyone so a dev can simply `pip install tryceratops` is as magic ‚ú® as runnning dinosaur commands ü¶ñ from your terminal.
There's several distinct ways of publishing a package to Pypi, and [`flit`](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the simplest one that I tried so far.

I didn't have to care about creating a `setup.py` and [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html) seemed too boring in comparison to the simplicity of writing a [config in pyproject](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/blob/c574aec/pyproject.toml#L5-L21).

The only challenge is to (remember to) keep `requires` up to date. I released two versions already without the proper dependencies set so they're unusable üòù. Sadly Pypi doesn't allow me to overwrite previous published versions with a new package.

## üõ£ Roadmap and Plans

I would say the next steps are:

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Test it more and collect real user feedback

Is it really useful? Does it really work? Is there any hidden bug?

Such questions I can only find out by using more and more the tool.

It's hard to promote something that is stil beta, hopefully I'll figure this out as I keep working on it.

**Please, let me know if you/your company found it useful, I'd be flattered to add your project to the main README as a "Tryceratops Supporter" ü¶ñüèÜ !**

**Critics and feedback are ALWAYS welcome, tell me if you hate it! I swear I won't cry too much ü•≤.**

### üöÄ Implement CI/CD

So far the release process is very manual! It requires me to run `flit`, update readme with new version, create a release on GitHub (for pre-commit), and I can't ensure tests are still passing.

I started the project following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) which is the perfect match of [semantic relase](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate versioning + generate changelogs + releases. I hope I can find the time to implement it someday later in the future.

### üöß Extend violations and analyzers with more scenarios

I need more scenarios! Yes, it's hard to create situations! For example, I realized that `TC003` is raised for: `raise Exception("long message")` but not for `raise module.Exception("long message")`. I totally need to find edge cases and make this tool robust, otherwise it fails by not providing the expected value.

Besides this, I believe there's still value in adding a few more violations for the `logging` usage within `except` blocks (which I don't think people usually know how to use properly, for example, do you know the difference between `logging.error` and `logging.exception`?).

I'm tracking planning and progress in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/projects/1) so anyone can check out.
